# zkFold: Ethereum integration library
Integration of zkFold Symbolic smart contracts with the Ethereum blockchain. The repository contains
- the smart contract specification;
- user documentation for zkFold Symbolic circuits;

## Smart contract specification

The smart contract specification defines the intended behavior of the on-chain code, namely the zkFold Symbolic verifier contract.

[specification](https://github.com/zkFold/zkfold-ethereum/tree/init-docs/e2e-test/specification)

## User documentation for zkFold Symbolic circuits

The user documentation contains the necessary information about the development of ZK smart contracts using zkFold Symbolic in application to Ethereum blockchain.

1) Write your own circuit with zkFold Symbolic (or import it from [example](https://github.com/zkFold/zkfold-base/tree/init-docs/example)).
2) Compile circuit with `compileIO` to scriptFile.
3) Import circuit to off-chain zkfold-ethereum. (in progress)
